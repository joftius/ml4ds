## Seminar notebooks

Here are links to all the current versions of notebooks. The _complete versions are for your reference and not for sharing with students. I think that every .html link can be edited to .Rmd to download the source. I'm going to try to clean up the site and make all the links updated so hopefully you won't even need to refer to this email, but here it is for reference in case I break something on the site

Week 2 regression

Week 3 causality
https://ml4ds.com/weeks/03-causality/notebooks/regression_causality.html

Week 3 update idea:  I might suggest going off-script and doing something to emphasize the differences in causal models, right after the direct causation X -> Y example you can do reverse causation X <- Y. The point would be to see that an ML model can still predict Y from X, but if people use that model because they're hoping to change Y by intervening on X then they will be disappointed
