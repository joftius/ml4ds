## Conceptual

### ISLR Section 5.4

- 2 (a-f), and calculate $e^{-1}$ to a few decimal places for comparison
- 3

### ISLR Section 6.6

- 2
- 5 

## Optional

The remaining exercises are option and will not be graded.

### Mathematics practice

- Can resampling methods be useful for addressing OOD generalization? If not, then why? If so, then how?

- Write out the objective function of the lasso for the case of linear regression with one predictor variable. Use calculus to find an expression for the solution (hint: you may need to consider cases)


### Applied practice

- ISLR Section 5.4, problem 8

- ISLR Section 6.6, problem 9 (a-d)

- ISLR Section 7.9, problem 9 (a-c)
