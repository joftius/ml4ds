## Preparation

### Required reading

- [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/) Chapter 3: Linear Regression.

This chapter is long but should be mostly a review of material from previous courses.

### Supplemental reading

- [ESL](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) corresponding chapters
- [MLstory](https://mlstory.org) Fundamentals of prediction and Supervised learning chapters

### Computer setup

Identify a dataset that you can use to fit a multiple regression model (one outcome variable, multiple predictor variables). This way you can work on an example dataset that you're personally interested in. If you can't find something or have trouble loading it into R in time there are backup options in these packages:

- `fivethirtyeight` https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/
- `palmerpenguins` https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/
- `modeldata` https://modeldata.tidymodels.org/
- `nycflights13` https://nycflights13.tidyverse.org/

Just be sure to identify in advance which variable you'll use as an
outcome to predict, and which variables you might use as predictors


## Machine learning before the information age

(under construction)

## Multiple regression

Regression, when conditioning on more than one predictor variable.
