## Preparation

### Required reading

- [Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/index.html) Sections 1.1, 1.2, and 3.1 up to 3.1.3 (stop before 3.1.4)
- [MLstory](https://mlstory.org/) Chapter 9 on Causality, roughly the first half (stop before the section called *Experimentation, randomization, potential outcomes*)

### Supplemental reading

- [Blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/double-machine-learning-for-causal-inference-78e0c6111f9d) on "double machine learning" up to the second histogram (note that material after that point is more advanced)
- [MLstory](https://mlstory.org/) Chapter 9 on Causality and Chapter 10 on Causal inference in practice
