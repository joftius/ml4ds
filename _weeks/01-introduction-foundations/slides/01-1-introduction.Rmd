# Quick preview

Don't worry about following all the details now

We'll introduce R coding gradually

Preview of some R


Model complexity: nonlinear vs relatively simple (linear) model

Linear model: may not fit the data as well

But! interpretable, one slope to summarize relationship

But! reliable/stable, 


Machine learning allows us to find models with just the right amount of complexity

# Teaching/course philosophy

???

Not just math, also my opinions

Textbooks are excellent, read them!

But! Value added by lectures

---

# Recurring themes

- Human-centric ML
  - Tools for us to control (not conversely)
  - Ethics of data science

--

- Interpretability
  - Philosophy of science
  - Causality vs "curve fitting"

--

- Social learning
  - Come post on the forum!
  - (More on this later)

???

Examples with ethical aspects

Explicit consideration of ethics and professional responsibilities of data scientists

Future lectures include a dose of philosophy, vaccinating against mindless application of tools

Don't be a zombie data scientist

Learn from each other, from people who we think are trustworthy...

# Please allow me

# to introduce

# myself

I'm Joshua Loftus

???

I'm the lecturer

For seminars, help from the very capable teaching staff

Am I trustworthy? Why should you listen to me? You decide!
