# Assessments

As described in the [course listing](https://www.lse.ac.uk/resources/calendar2020-2021/courseGuides/ST/2020_ST310.htm)

- Formative
  - Problem sets every 2 weeks
- Summative
  - Final project (30%)
  - Summer exam (70%)

(I believe the summer exams may be remote?)

(Whatever the university decides, that's what we're doing)

### Let's all do our best, and be understanding!

# Quick preview

Don't worry about following all the details now

We'll introduce R coding gradually

.panelset[
  .panel[.panel-name[Data]
```{r gapminder}
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% head() %>% kable()
```
  
  ]
  .panel[.panel-name[Code]
  
```{r plot-example, fig.show = "hide"}
gdp_data <- gapminder %>%
  `filter`(year == max(year))

life_exp_plot <- 
  ggplot(gdp_data, `aes`(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +

                   shape = continent,
                   size = pop)) +

Preview of some R


Model complexity: nonlinear vs relatively simple (linear) model

Linear model: may not fit the data as well

But! interpretable, one slope to summarize relationship

But! reliable/stable, 


Machine learning allows us to find models with just the right amount of complexity

# Teaching/course philosophy

???

Not just math, also my opinions

Textbooks are excellent, read them!

But! Value added by lectures

---

# Recurring themes

- Human-centric ML
  - Tools for us to control, not conversely...
  - Ethics of data science

--

- Interpretability
  - Philosophy of science
  - Causality vs "curve fitting"

--

- Social learning
  - Come post on the forum!
  - (More on this later)

???

Examples with ethical aspects

Explicit consideration of ethics and professional responsibilities of data scientists

Future lectures include a dose of philosophy, vaccinating against mindless application of tools

Don't be a zombie data scientist

Learn from each other, from people who we think are trustworthy...

# Please allow me

# to introduce

# myself

I'm Joshua Loftus

I'm the lecturer

For seminars, help from the very capable Phil Chan

Am I trustworthy? Why should you listen to me? You decide!
